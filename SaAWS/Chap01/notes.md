## Going Serverless

     Serverless is a misnomer. Where you use a compute service such as AWS Lambda to execute code or interact
     with an API, there are still servers in the background. The difference is that these servers are hidden.
     There is no infrastructure for the developer to think about. No way to tweak the underlying OS. Someone
     else takes care of the workings of the infrastructure management, freeing the developer to other things.
     Serverless is about running code in a compute service and interacting with services and APIs to get
     the job done. [1]

 For example in AWS Lambda functions are executed in *containers*. Containers are a server virtualization method
 where the kernel of the OS implements multiple isolated environments. With Lambda, physical servers still execute
 the code, but the developer does not need to spend time managing it. **It is common to call this approach serverless**
 [2]

 Typical web applications, the server accepts the HTTP requests from the front end and processes requests. Data might travel through numerous application layers before being saved to a database. The back end. finally, generates a response -- it could be in the form of JSON or XML, or fully rendered markup -- which is sent back to the client. Underlying this the system is much more complex and may include load balancing, transactions, clustering, caching, messaging, and data redundancy. This requires servers running in data centers **or in the cloud** that need to be **manageed, patched and backed up** [1.1]

**Platform-as-a-Service ( PasS ) and containers** have been introduced as a solution to inconsistent infrastructure environments, conflicts and server management overhead.  **PaaS is a form of cloud computing that provides a platform for users to run their software while hiding some of the underlying infrastructure**
Good use is to write to PaaS. Otherwise moving legacy applications to designed to run on a standalone server to PaaS may require additional resources and effort due to the ephemeral nature of PaaS implementations.

**Containerization is a way of isolating an application with its own environments. It is a light weight alternative to full blown virtualization** Containers are isolated and lightweight but they need to be deployed to a server -- whether in a public or private cloud, or onsite. They are an excellent solution when dependencies are in play but they have their own "housekeeping" challenges and complexities. **They are not as easy as simply running code directly in the cloud** [1.2]

**Lambda** is a compute service from AWS. **Lambda can execute code in a massively parallelized way in response to events.**
Lambda takes the developer's code and runs it without any need to provision servers, install software, deploy containers, or worry about low-level details( and OS ). AWS takes care of provisioning and management of their EC2 servers that run the actual code and provides a high-availability computer infrastructure--include capacity provisioning and automated scaling.
**Serverless architecture refers to these kinds of software architectures that do not rely on direct access to a server to work** By taking Lambda and making use of various powerful single-purpose APIs and web services, developers can build loosely coupled, scalable and efficient architectures quickly. *Moving away from servers and infrastructure concerns, as well as* **allowing the developer to primarily to focus on code is the ultimate goal behind serverless**.

## Service-Oriented Architecture and & Microservices

SOA is an architecture that clearly conceptualized the idea that a system cab be composed of many independent services. Much of SOA is still misunderstood because **developers often confuse design philosophy with specific implementation and attributes.** SOA does not dictate the user of any particular technology. Instead, it encourages an architectural approach in which developers create autonomous services that communicate via message passing and, **often have a schema** or a contract that defines how messages are created or exchanged. **Service reuseability and autonomy, composability, granularity, and discoverability are all important principles associated with SOA**

Think of Microservices and serverless architectures as spiritual descendants of service-oriented architecture. They retain a lot of the aforementioned principles and ideas while attempting to address the complexity of old-fashioned SOA. A reconciliation of the past SOA ideas with practice.

**Microservices are small, standalone, fully independent services built around a particular purpose or capability. A microservice may have an application tier with its own API and database.**


SA does adopts some of the mantras of microservices, i.e for example, one can consider each function to be its own standalone service, with its own business purpose.

## Serverless architecture gives the developer freedom to apply as few or as many microservices principles without forcing him/her to a single path.

One of the solutions that SA tries to alleviate is the complexity arising from too many abstractions. Although layering allows developers to decouple concerns and have more maintainable applications. The converse is also true. **Too many moving parts** can lead to inefficiencies. **A small change can often cascade and cause the developer to modify every layer throughout the system** costing a lot of time and expenditure. The more layers there are the more complex and unwieldy the system might become over time.

	SA tries to remove or minimize layers by breaking systems into functions and allowing the frontend
	to securely communicate with services and even the database directly.

One of the main emphasis for any developer is to find a balance in preventing spaghetti implementations, and dependacy nightmares by clearly defining service boundaries, allowing Lambda functions to be autonomous and planning how functions and services will interact.

SA doesn't solve all problems and may not remove underlying intricacies of the system. When implemented correctly it can provide opportunities to
   * reduce
   * organize
   * manage complexity

It can also make future changes easier for a long term application.

     Tiers vs Layers
     A Tier is a module boundary that exists to provides isolation between major components of a system.
     A presentation tier is visible to the user is separate from the application tier which encompasses
     business logic. Data in a tier is another separate system that can manage, persist and provide
     access to data. Components grouped in a tier can physically reside on different architecture.

     Layers are logical slices that carry specific responsibilities in an application. Each tier can have
     multiple layers within it responsible for different elements of functionality such as domain services.


# Five Principles of Serverless Architectures


   1. **Use a compute service to execute code on demand ( no servers )**
   2. **Write single-purpose stateless functions**
   3. **Design push-based, event-driven pipelines**
   4. **Create thicker, more powerful front ends**
   5. **Embrace third-party services**

# 1.SA is a natural extension of ideas raised in SOA

  Developers can write functions to carryout almost any common task, such as reading and writing to a data source, calling other functions, and performing a calculation.

       Lambda is a compute service that executes code written in JavaScript(node.js), Python or Java, and now
       includes GOlang in AWS infrastructure
       Source code is deployed to an isolated container that has its own allocation of memory, disk space,
       and CPU. A lambda function is the combination of code, configuration and dependencies created by the
       developer. The Lambda runtime can invoke a function multiple times in parallel. Lambda supports push
       and pull event models of operation integrates with a large number of AWS services, Functions can
       be invoked by an HTTP request through the API Gateway, or run on a scheduler.

**MS AZURE, IBM Bluemix OpenWhisk, Google Cloud Functions are other compute services that compete with AWS lambda**

# 2.Single-purpose stateless functions

   A good practice is to write functions with the **Single Responsibility Principle** ( SRP ) **A function that does just one thing is more testable, robust and leads to fewer bugs and unexpected side effects** By composing functions and services together in a loose orchestration, a developer can build complex back end systems that are still understandable and easy to manage. **A granular function with well-defined interface is also more likely to be re-used within an SA**
   **All code written in Lambda must be stateless**

**Stateless allows for scalability** quickly scale to handle an ever-changing number of incoming events or requests.


# 3. Design Push-based, Event-driven pipelines

   Systems can be built from scratch or monolithic systems can be re-engineered to take advantage of SA.
   **Event-Drive, Push-based pipeline to show how quickly a system can be put together, e.g. to encode video to different bitrates and formats**. This can be achieved by connecting to **Amazon's Simple Storage ( S3 ), Lambda and Elastic transcoder**.
   **One of the advantages of building an event-driven, push-based system is that it will reduce cost and complexity ( a developer will not need to run extra code to poll for changes) and make UX smoother. event-driven, push-based may not be applicable to all circumstances. At times a lambda function may need to be implemented that polls the event source or runs on a schedule.
