## Building Software Platforms: A Guide to SaaS Transition with AWS

```text
To stay competitive and maintain an edge, software companies and IT organizations must reinvent their way 
of working and embark on a journey to find solutions that empower them with the right capabilities to build modern software. 
And deliver it as a service. And do it continuously.

How are high-performing software companies solving these risks and constraints then? The answer is by building tools to show their 
developers that they believe in them as creative problem solvers they are trying to help. There is nothing more motivating for a software 
development team than having an efficient SDLC that maximizes the value they create. To achieve this, successful software companies 
need to start treating every software engineering problem as per the tenets of a physics problem: data has mass, computing consumes energy, 
and network takes time. By realizing that these are finite resources at the disposal of development teams, you will be better positioned to 
design and build the necessary internal tools that enable those efficient SDLCs and remove the obstacles in every developer’s way to 
deliver business value. And that’s where internal software platforms come into play.

Building Software Platforms is a nonsense-free, principles-based guide to help software engineering and architecture leaders like you 
roll out this new architectural style so that development teams can focus on building and delivering value for the end-users. In this book, 
the author shares the secrets of internal software platforms and introduces adoption strategies using Wardley maps.

To assist in this transition, Building Software Platforms curates an assortment of AWS innovations that describe how to design and implement 
many of the recommendations using AWS managed cloud services, with a preference for Serverless computing.
